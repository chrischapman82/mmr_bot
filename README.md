## /UPDATE


ChappysBot reads through starcraft reddit and finds phrases that contain the !mmr command.
Creates a comment in reply with the top names sorted by matchmaking.
Similar in function to the !mmr bot on twitch.

Example functionality:

!mmr Chappy NA 3    -> Returns top 3 results containing the name "Chappy" on the NA server

!mmr Chappy EU      -> Returns top 5 results containing "Chappy" in EU

!mmr Chappy 2       -> Returns top 2 results containing "Chappy"

!mmr Chappy         -> Returns top 5 results containing "Chappy"



eg. !mmr Chappy 8

Displaying top 8 results:

ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ Chappy: 5525 Z

ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ Chappy: 5459 Z

ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· Chappy: 5182 Z

ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ Chappy: 4865 P

ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ chappy: 4832 Z
